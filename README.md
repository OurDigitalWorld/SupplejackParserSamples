# SupplejackParserSamples
A collection of Supplejack parsers

This is a collection of parsers that we use to harvest content for our Supplejack BCDL/ODW demo instance. 

You can currently view the ember.js front-end [for the demo instance] at: http://eln-sj4.is.sfu.ca:8000/search

Jurisdiction specific variants of this front-end can be viewed at: http://eln-sj4.is.sfu.ca:8001/search [BC] and http://eln-sj4.is.sfu.ca:8002/search [ON]

You can view/explore/fork these instances here: 

- https://github.com/OurDigitalWorld/supplejack-ember
- https://github.com/telezoic/telezoic-supplejack-client
- https://github.com/telezoic/supplejack-clientBC
- https://github.com/telezoic/supplejack-clientON


and you can read the docs here: https://github.com/OurDigitalWorld/supplejack-ember/wiki

This collection also includes a parser template, and a code snippet for reuse in specific parsers. Also included is the record_schema.rb we use for these parsers

Note: some of the parsers reference metadata files rather than OAI endpoints. If you want to download/access/manipulate these files they are located at http://eln-sj4.is.sfu.ca/data
